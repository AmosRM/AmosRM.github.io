## Wordle
Basic EDA for my favorite daily word game. Using a daily sample of Wordle ~tweets~ (hyperlink to the database) and comparing to actual daily answers.

## DATA
The data I was originally using was from a Kaggle dataset, later I have worked up to gather data using Web Scraping (answers) and Twitter API for tweets.
Twitter data was collected by searching â€˜ðŸŸ© Wordleâ€™ and collecting. This focused the search for tweets that share the results of the daily Wordle game.
